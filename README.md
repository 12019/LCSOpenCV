# LCSOpenCV
Project currently broken. Was able to use opencv and tesseract ocr to grab data from screenshots of Riot's LCS stream. 

### Note
I wrote this some time ago as my first experiment with OpenCV.
Not taking this experiment as a serious project, the way files were linked in this repository went wrong, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to ressurect it.
In addition, many of the code fragments in this project (particularily the image matching algorithm) are owed to stackoverflow and the opencv documentation.
Screenshots were grabbed using FFmpeg and https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer during the NA LCS Summer Split of 2014.

### Results
Had perfect accuracy identifying champions and summoners, 95 percent accuracy on scores and about 70 percent accuracy on items.
